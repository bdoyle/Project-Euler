// Java Solution:

// Problem 5:
// 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers
//   from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

// What is the smallest positive number that is evenly
// 	divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

public class Problem5{
	
	// Testing can begin at 2520, we are told that this is the smallest number
	//	evenly divisible by all numbers 1-10, so no number smaller than that can
	//	possibly be evenly divisible by all numbers 1-20.
	private static int start = 2520;
	
	// Any number that is evenly divisible by 11-20 will also be evenly
	//	divisible by all numbers 1-10. So only testing 11-20 should make the
	//	program slightly more efficient.

	//	Returns start after it is proven evenly divisible by every number stored 
	//	in tests[].
